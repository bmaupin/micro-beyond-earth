#### Avoid duel and dwarf map sizes

To prevent the game from crashing, avoid duel and dwarf map sizes when creating new games for development purposes, because it's likely the game will need to be saved and reloaded multiple times and this is what triggers the crash. See [../README.md](../README.md) for more information.
