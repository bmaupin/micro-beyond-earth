## To do

- [x] Mod map sizes
- [ ] Add option to disable Covert Ops
- [ ] Play with modded map sizes
- [ ] Enable hidden game options
- [ ] Disable buildings and wonders related to hidden game options
- [ ] Update for Rising Tide DLC
- [ ] Give all cities a free Ultrasonic fence?
  - This prevents turns from auto-ending and can slow down the game quite a bit at the beginning. But would it be too big of a negative impact on the game?

## Known issues

#### Incompatible with Promised Land victory

Because this mod significantly reduces the map sizes, it is likely that the purity affinity victory (Promised Land) will not be possible with the mod because there may not be enough space on the map to settle the new colonists required for the victory.

#### Game crashes with `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION`

This error can happen for a number of reasons, not always related to this mod.

If an odd number is used for one of the values of the map size, it will cause the game to crash with this error just before the map is shown. The fix is to only use even numbers. This should be resolved but this note serves as a reminder in case the map sizes are adjusted in the future and this issue happens again.
